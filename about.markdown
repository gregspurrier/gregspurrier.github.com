title: About Source Matters
---
![Greg Spurrier](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/13e707bdd496968722584cc1a50881d3?s=100 "Photo of Greg Spurrier") My name is Greg Spurrier. I've been a professional software engineer for 16 years, but developing software means much more to me than just paying the bills. It has been a passion of mine since writing my first BASIC programs in the 5th grade.

Creating a great user experience is important. To me, the underlying source code and system design--things the user will never see--are just as important. Source matters. This blog is an expression of my passion for the craft of software development and the tools that make it possible.
